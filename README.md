<p>When creating the converter, the following technologies were used:</p>
<ul>
  <li>HTML - for creating application markup</li>
  <li>CSS- for writing block styles. When naming block classes, I followed the BEM methodology so that the blocks could be reused in the code.</li>
  <li>JS- used to write the entire application logic.</li>
  <li>The fetch method is used to send network requests to the server, as well as promises for processing incoming requests.

`fetch (https://api.exchangerate.host/convert)`
  
  </li>
</ul>
